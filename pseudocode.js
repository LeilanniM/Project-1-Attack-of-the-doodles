Q: What do we want next? 
A:  
    1.-Create a second bad guy with horizontal stroke. DONE 
    2.-make him spawn slightly later than first guy. DONE

    Created first 4 enemies.
    They Move.

    BUT They spawn from the beginning, we want them to spawn not to always extist on the screen

    Ultimate goal for phase 1: 

    -find out how many bad guys level 1 has (28ish)
    -emulate that on my game 
    -how many enemies appear on the screen at a time
